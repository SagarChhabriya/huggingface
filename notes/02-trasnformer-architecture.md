# Transfomer Architecture
Encoders, decoders, encoder-decoders.


## Encoder

The encoder outputs a numerical representation for each word used as input.

- Bidirectional: Context from the left, and the right.
- Good at extracting meaningful information. 
- Sequence classification, question answering, masked language modeling.
- NLU: Natural Language Understanding.
- Example: BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT


### Masked Language Modeling
Guessing a randomly masked word.
